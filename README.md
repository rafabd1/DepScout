    <b>A high-performance, concurrent scanner for detecting Dependency Confusion vulnerabilities.</b>
</p>

## Features

- **Dependency Confusion Scanning**: Identifies potential Dependency Confusion vulnerabilities by scanning JavaScript files for package names and checking their existence on the public npm registry.
- **Dual Parsing Engine**:
  - **Regex Mode**: Fast, high-performance scanning using fine-tuned regular expressions to find `require()` and `import` statements.
  - **Deep Scan Mode (`--deep-scan`)**: High-accuracy scanning using a full Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser to eliminate false positives from non-code contexts (e.g., comments). Includes an automatic fallback to regex if AST parsing fails.
- **Concurrent Architecture**: Leverages a powerful, concurrent worker model to perform high-speed fetching and analysis of hundreds or thousands of files simultaneously.
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Features a smart, per-domain rate limiter that automatically adjusts request speeds based on server responses (e.g., `429 Too Many Requests`), maximizing speed without overwhelming targets.
- **Flexible Input**: Accepts targets from single URLs (`-u`), files (`-f`), local directories (`-d`), or piped via `stdin`.
- **Advanced Configuration**: Provides a rich set of CLI flags for fine-grained control over concurrency, timeouts, file sizes, and more.
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Delivers results in human-readable text or machine-readable `JSON` (`--json`).

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rafabd1/DepScout.git
cd DepScout

# Build the binary
go build -o depscout ./cmd/depscout

# Optional: Move to path (Linux/macOS)
sudo mv depscout /usr/local/bin/
```

### Using Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/rafabd1/DepScout/cmd/depscout@latest
```

### Binary Releases

You can download pre-built binaries for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/rafabd1/DepScout/releases).

## Quick Start

Scan a single JavaScript file:
```bash
depscout -u https://example.com/assets/app.js
```

Scan a local directory of JS files using the high-accuracy deep scan mode:
```bash
depscout -d /path/to/js/files --deep-scan
```

Scan a list of URLs from a file, increase concurrency, and save results to a JSON file:
```bash
cat urls.txt | depscout -c 100 -o results.json --json
```

## Command Line Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-u` | A single target URL or local file path. | - |
| `-f` | A file containing a list of targets. | - |
| `-d` | Path to a local directory to scan for `.js` and `.ts` files. | - |
| `-c` | Number of concurrent workers. | `25` |
| `-l` | Maximum requests per second per domain (in auto-adjustment mode). | `30` |
| `-H` | Custom header to include in all requests (can be specified multiple times). | - |
| `-o` | File to write output to. | stdout |
| `-p` | File containing a list of proxies (http/https/socks5). | - |
| `--deep-scan` | Enable deep scan using AST parsing (slower but more accurate). | `false` |
| `--json` | Enable JSON output format. | `false` |
| `--max-file-size` | Maximum file size to process in KB. | `10240` |
| `--no-limit` | Disable file size limit. | `false` |
| `--skip-verify` | Skip TLS certificate verification. | `false` |
| `-v` | Enable verbose output for debugging. | `false` |
| `--silent` | Suppress all output except for findings. | `false` |
| `--no-color` | Disable colorized output. | `false` |
